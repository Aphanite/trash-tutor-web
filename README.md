## What is Trash Tutor?

Trash Tutor is a personal project by [Ena RajoviÄ‡](https://aphanite.net) designed to explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a production-ready application.

It assists users in recycling more effectively by using their device's camera to identify waste items and providing region-specific disposal instructions.

## Installation/Usage

To install all dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

To start the local development server:

```

```

To expose the local development server on the network, e.g. for testing on the phone:

```
yarn dev --host
```

### HTTPS

If you want to access Trash Tutor on the local network on your phone, you must enable https.
Accessing the camera with `getUserMedia()` is only allowed on secure (https) connections or localhost.

#### Run once per computer / phone
